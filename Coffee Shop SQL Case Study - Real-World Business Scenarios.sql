Context:
You're a Data Professional working for a coffee shop chain. Your job is to optimize operations, 
analyze trends, and ensure data accuracy using SQL.

   SQL Concept to Cover:
-	Joins & Exploration
-	Date/Time & Interval Arithmetic
-	Aggregation, GROUP BY & HAVING
-	Common Table Expressions (CTEs) & Subqueries
-	Window Functions & Ranking
-	Recursive CTEs
-	Conditional Logic, Pivoting & Un pivoting
-	View Creation & Safe Joins
-	Optimization Techniques
